canny
=====

Canny is a \$5 implementation of a controller for the cheap bulbs sold under the
brands MiLight, LimitlessLed, Easybulb or any other futlight clone.

It uses a ESP8266 device and a nRF24L01 radio module to directly interface with
the compatible bulbs.

note: this project is not yet out-of-the-box deployable. Drop me a message if
you'd like to test.

 

Features
--------

Canny pretends to overcome the limitations of these devices by bringing
additional features and reliability.

 

Gateway capabilities:

-   Individually control up to 2048 bulbs

Software capabilities:

-   Manual control over bulbs or groups of bulbs

-   Geofence rules

-   Timers

-   Bulbs as notification devices for smartphone calls, others

Security:

-   Additional security to standard milight/easybulb bridge authentication
